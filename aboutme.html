<p style="text-align:center;font-size:25px">I like to read and draw. My favorite color is blue. When I'm not at school, 
  I'm either reading or thinking.I love to go to church.I am sixteen years old and I have a twin.</p>

                  Blue...Loop Yellow... Conditional Lime Green...Variable Red...Function </h1>
     <p style="text-align:left;font-size:20px"<
  -Look at the command outlined in dark blue! These represent loops in coding! Loops are known to be sequences that are continually repeated until a certain condition is achieved in a program.
Next the command outlined in yellow is called a conditional!Conditionals are also known as "if" statements. If 
statements or conditional expressions will execute different results depending on the input received or typed/pushed/clicked 
by the user.In other words: if a condition(what you want your program to do!) is met, or "true,",a desired output is executed 
from that conditional. Look at the second picture. There outlined in lime green is something called a variable.(These can be 
placed within loops and conditionals)A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditionals or information passed 
to the program.They act as "storage locations" for data in a program. They also have the job  of receiving certain input from
the user in the beginning to use it later or at the end of the run. When a certain game will need to track a player or several 
player's scores at the same time,more often than not, variables are set to 0 in the beginning and either decrease/increase by a certain 
number put in place(in order to keep scores "clean").Finally functions are ones that look like the outlined command in red! Functions 
are known to make programming easier for the daily coder. The reason is because they shorten a blocks of code that may have to be 
repeated more than once.One must first "Define" their block of code and then in the middle provide the steps or certain commands
that must be followed every time the function goes to work. In simple terms, they encapsulate a whole bunch of lines of code into 
a single organized line.</p>

  <h1 style=text-align:center;font-size:30px>Day 1 Reflection</h1>
  <p style=text-align:left;font-size:20px>How did your idea of robotics change?
    <br>
   - I became more aware of the general field of robotics. I could also understand
    some general rules many people who work in the field of robotics have to think about when
    using or constructing robots. For example: coding, different parts and how they connect.
    <br>
    What makes you nervous about the future of robotics?Nervous?
    <br>
    -The chance that someone evil may become obsessed with creating something to destroy humanity. Nervous?Yes.
    <br>
    You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest of the week.What worked well?
    What could you do better next time?
    <br>
    -Something that worked well was the fact that I (and the rest of the "team" could have at least have one 
    chance at seeing the robot or trying to modify the wires and resistors so that the red LED
    could light up.Something the team could have done better was to pass around the robot with the Arduino 
    more often so that everyone could see it more clearly and have a better understanding for their first look 
    at using a motherboard.

  <h1 style=text-align:center;font-size:30px>Day 2 Robotics </h1>
  <p style=text-align:left;font-size:20px>What does Manuela Veloso's work have in common with Ayanna Howards'?
  <br>
   -First of all, both women have an incredible amount of experience in the field they are working.
    Second, both participate in creative construction dealing with robots. Third, what they do 
    can potentially have a direct impact on the human society all over the world.
    <br>
    How did your team work together on the lightshow? How could your teamwork have improved?
    <br>
   -We tried passing around the robot Arduino around to each partner to try to figure out 
    how to make the amount of LED lights given to us light up in a series of patterns. Every person tried 
    a different way to position the resistors, jumper wires, LED lights so that the electricity could flow 
    from one thing to the other. We could have taken much more time to ask each other questions pertaining to 
    the project so that we could figure out the solution much quicker. That was needed so that rather than 
    each person silently in  their head trying to figure out the solution to the problem, the ENTIRE group 
    could have understood what was actually going on, hahaha.
