     <p style="text-align:center;">Look at the command outlined in dark blue! These represent loops in coding!
       Loops are known to be sequences that are continually repeated until a certain condition is achieved in a program.
Next the command outlined in yellow is called a conditional!Conditionals are also known as "if" statements. If 
statements or conditional expressions will execute different results depending on the input received or typed/pushed/clicked 
by the user.In other words: if a condition(what you want your program to do!) is met, or "true,",a desired output is executed 
from that conditional.</p>
